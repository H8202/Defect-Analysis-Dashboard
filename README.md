# üõ†Ô∏è Defect Analysis Dashboard | Power BI + Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning and data visualization to analyze and reduce manufacturing defects. A Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict defect occurrence, and key insights are presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard. This tool is designed to support operations teams in identifying root causes and improving process performance.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Objective**: Identify key contributors to product defects and visualize actionable insights for decision-making.
- **Approach**: Conduct exploratory analysis, clean and preprocess data, train classification models, and deploy findings in a Power BI dashboard.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a dashboard that helps operations and quality teams understand and mitigate defect risks.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before modeling, I conducted EDA to understand data behavior and early defect patterns.

### Key Insights:
- **Maintenance hours** showed the strongest correlation with defect rates.
- **Quality scores** were significantly lower for defective products.
- **Production volume** has moderate correlation but does not show a strong visual separation between defective and non-defective products.
- No missing values were found, but some columns unrelated to process performance were dropped.

### Summary Statistics:
Used `pandas.describe()` to evaluate:
- Mean, median, min, max of process variables
- Distribution of numeric features
- Detection of skew and spread across variables

### Visualizations Used:
- Pairplots for maintanence hours, quality score, and produdction plot
- Correlation heatmap

*EDA supported later feature selection and business interpretation of the model.*

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Summary

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Baseline**: Logistic Regression
- **Imbalance Handling**: Used **SMOTE** to balance class distribution, since non-defective parts were a minority class.

### Evaluation Metrics for Defects:
| Metric        | Random Forest | Logistic Regression |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Accuracy      | 86%            | 78%                  |
| Precision     | 74%            | 65%                  |
| Recall        | 92%            | 59%                  |
| F1 Score      | 82%            | 61%                  |

### Evaluation Metrics for Non-Defects:
| Metric        | Random Forest | Logistic Regression |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Accuracy      | 86%            | 78%                  |
| Precision     | 52%            | 37%                  |
| Recall        | 59%            | 71%                  |
| F1 Score      | 56%            | 49%                  |

* Random Forest is most effective at identifying defective items, which is critical in manufacturing if missing a defect is costly*
* Random forest offers better balance as seen by a higher F1 score for both defects and non-defects*
